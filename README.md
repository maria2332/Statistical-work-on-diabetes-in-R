## 🎓 Academic Context

This project was developed as part of a **Statistics course assignment**, with the objective of
applying statistical concepts and data analysis techniques using **R**.

The focus of the project is not only computational, but also **interpretative**, emphasizing
statistical reasoning, clarity of results, and correct methodological decisions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on diabetes datasets
- Apply **basic and intermediate statistical techniques**
- Interpret results in a health-related context
- Use **R Markdown** to combine code, results, and narrative
- Develop reproducible statistical analyses

---

## 🧠 Methodology

The analysis follows a structured workflow implemented in **R Markdown**:

1. **Data loading**
   - Importing CSV datasets
   - Initial inspection of variables

2. **Data preprocessing**
   - Cleaning and restructuring data
   - Creation of new variables
   - Generation of intermediate datasets

3. **Exploratory Analysis**
   - Descriptive statistics
   - Distribution analysis
   - Variable comparison

4. **Visualization**
   - Plots generated dynamically in R
   - Visual support for statistical interpretation

> ℹ️ Visualizations are generated during execution and are **embedded in the HTML output**.
> They are not stored as separate image files in the repository.

---

## 📊 Visualizations

All graphs are created using **R code within the R Markdown document** and rendered directly
in the final HTML report.

This approach allows:
- Full reproducibility
- Tight integration of code, output, and explanation
- Clean project structure without static image files

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **R**
- **R Markdown**
- CSV data handling
- Statistical analysis functions
- Data visualization in R

## 📌 Key Learnings

Importance of data cleaning prior to analysis

Role of visualization in understanding statistical patterns

How R Markdown supports reproducible research

Interpretation matters more than numerical output alone

## 🔍 Final Remarks

This project reflects an academic approach to statistical analysis in R, combining
methodology, interpretation, and reproducibility.

It demonstrates the use of R as a tool for structured statistical reasoning,
particularly in health-related datasets such as diabetes.
